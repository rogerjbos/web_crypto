      <description>Greetings. I am Roger J. Bos and I have a strong passion for finance, equities, and macroeconoimcs. In addition to my passion for traditional finance, I also have a passion for crypto and blockchain technology.
I run the [BOS] Stake Pool for Cardano.
My goal is to empower others to revolutionise their thinking, open their minds to new disruptive technology and increase their ADA through staking. I want to help build the Cardano ecosystem and contribute to decentralization.</description>

      <description>WARNING: NEVER SEND YOUR ADA TO ANOTHER ADDRESS TO STAKE! PLEASE SEE BELOW.
FAQ
Could I lose my ADA during staking? No, your ADA never leaves your wallet when you stake. Staking is a feature built into the Daedalus and Yoroi wallets that allows you to delegate your funds for a return on stake in the selected pool. In case you are not aware, with the Daedalus wallet you have to sync up the complete Cardano blockchain while the Yoroi wallet is a light wallet that does not require full syncing.</description>
