      <description>Introduction I have been a HODLer of the ZIL token from Zilliqa for over a year now. It hasn&amp;rsquo;t done very well, but I tend to hold my crypto projects long term because I hate paying capital gains taxes, so I just avoid that by not selling. I have been staking my ZIL on Moonlet and getting a 13.6% yield, but moonlet has a 14 day unbonding period when you unstake which I am not completely happy with.</description>

      <description>Introduction Osmosis bills itself as the first IBC-native Cosmos interchain AMM. AMM stands for automated market maker, which means it provides swap pools that allow users to trade one token for another. interchain refers to a new feature of the latest version of the Cosmos DSK that allows Inter Blockchain Compatability (IBC) which allows transferring tokens from one blockchain to another. This is exciting stuff in that it will allow digital assets to move more freely around the ecosystem and not be stuck in individual chains.</description>

      <description>Introduction Curve Finance is a DeFi protocol that works will many different blockchain networks. The top right menu item Network can be used to view available networks and choose which one to use. While many DeFi apps (called Dapps) only work on Ethereum, Curve Finance works on seven different blockchains:
 Ethereum Arbitrum Avalanche Fantom Harmony Polygon xDai  I recently posted yield farming on Curve Finance using Polygon and today I am going to talk about using Curve on the Fantom Network.</description>

      <description>Introduction QuickSwap is a fork of Uniswap that runs on the Polygon network. I have written about Polygon in previous posts and how much less expensive it is to transact with compared to Ethereum.
QiDao is a protocol that allows users to lock tokens as collator and borrow MAI stable coin interest free. MAI is the stable coin used on the QiDao protocol and its name comes from miMatic, which represents MATIC on the QiDao protocol.</description>

      <title>Yield Farming on Kava</title>

      <description>Introduction KAVA is the native token issued by Kava Labs, which has a protocol that makes it easy to borrow and lend crypto to earn yield. Kava Labs runs on a separate blockchain on the Cosmos SDK. I started getting interested in Kava after watching an interview on Real Vision Cyrpto.
I noticed that one of the centralized exchanges I use, Kraken, was offering a 20% yield for staking Kava, so I purchased some KAVA and staked it on Kraken.</description>

      <title>Yield Farming on Shape Shift</title>
      <link>https://crypto.rogerjbos.com/yield-farming-on-shape-shift/</link>

      <description>Intro What is DeFi and Yield Farming? DeFi stands for Decentralized Finance and it represents financial services such as lending and borrowing that are provided over the blockchain. The decentralized part means that instead of having a bank stand between the lender and the borrower, taking a large cut, a protocal (some code and a blockchain) is the intermediary instead. The protocal still takes a cut, but it is much smaller than in TradFi (Traditional Finance).</description>
