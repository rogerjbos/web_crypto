    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p><a href="https://info.quickswap.exchange/home">QuickSwap</a> is a fork of <a href="https://uniswap.org/">Uniswap</a> that runs on the <a href="https://polygon.technology/">Polygon network</a>.  I have written about Polygon in previous posts and how much less expensive it is to transact with compared to Ethereum.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.mai.finance/">QiDao</a> is a protocol that allows users to lock tokens as collator and borrow <strong>MAI</strong> stable coin interest free.  <strong>MAI</strong> is the stable coin used on the QiDao protocol and its name comes from miMatic, which represents <em>MATIC</em> on the QiDao protocol.  <strong>Qi</strong> is the governance token for the QiDao protocol.</p>
<p>The first step is to post some collateral and borrow some <strong>MAI</strong>.  On QiDao you do this by creating a vault, adding collateral, and then borrow <strong>MAI</strong> against that collateral.  In my case I have some <strong>CRV</strong> tokens on the Polygon network.  Ideally I would like to stake those <strong>CRV</strong> on Curve Finance to earn staking rewards, but that has to be done on Ethereum and I don&rsquo;t have enough <strong>CRV</strong> to justify the Ethereum gas fees, so I will deposit my <strong>CRV</strong> on QiDao, borrow <strong>MAI</strong>, and yield farm on Quickswap.  Here we go.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-vault">Create a vault</h3>
<p>There is a different vault for each eligible digital asset.  In the screen shot below you can see that I choose the <strong>CRV</strong> vault, so I can <em>Depsit</em> <strong>CRV</strong> and then I can <em>Brorrow</em> a portion of the collateral value in <strong>MAI</strong>, but I have to keep the collateral value above 130% of the amount of <strong>MAI</strong> that I borrowed.  When I am done with the <strong>MAI</strong>, I can <em>Repay</em> the loan.  There is no interest expense, but there is a 0.5% flat fee to repay the loan.  Once the loan is repaid, I can <em>Withdraw</em> my <strong>CRV</strong> to complete the cycle.  Of course, if I let the collateral value drop below 130% I am subject to liquidation, so I will have to keep an eye on that.</p>
<p><img src="/img/qidao_vault.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a real example.  In deposited 34.4 <strong>CRV</strong> token with a collateral value of just under $175.  The app tells me I can borrow almost 135 <strong>MAI</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/img/qidao_borrow.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="borrow-mai-from-your-vault">Borrow MAI from your vault</h3>
<p>Next I click the <em>Borrow</em> button and borrow 72.6 <strong>MAI</strong>, which gives me a collateral to debt ratio of 240%.  This is way above the 130% minimum, so I am not at risk of being liquidated anytime soon.  I like to be conservative when investing with DeFi.</p>
<p><img src="/img/qi_dao_vault_546.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="add-liquidity-to-a-pool">Add Liquidity to a Pool</h3>
<p>Now that I have some (borrowed) <strong>MAI</strong> in my wallet, I want to look for a pool to add liquidity to.  I went to <a href="https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap">Quickswap Exchange</a>, clicked on <em>Pool</em> and looked for a pair where I had both assets.  Most pools are <strong>MAI</strong> and something else.  I have some of my favorite <strong>MATIC</strong> tokens, so I choose the <strong>MATIC/miMATIC</strong> pool.  (Recall that <strong>miMATIC</strong> is another name for <strong>MAI</strong>).  I deposited the 72.5 <strong>MAI</strong> that I borrowed along with 36.6 <strong>MATIC</strong> that I had in my wallet.</p>
<p><img src="/img/polyswap_add_liquidity.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="get-lp-tokens">Get LP tokens</h3>
<p>After I approve the transaction I end up with 41.49 <strong>MATIC/miMATIC</strong> LP tokens.</p>
<p><img src="/img/polyswap_pool.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="depost-lp-tokens-on-quickswap">Depost LP tokens on Quickswap</h3>
<p>Once I have my LP tokens, I still need to deposit them before I can start to earn rewards.  As the screen shot shows, my 41.49 <strong>MATIC/miMATIC</strong> LP tokens are worth about $143 at the time of deposit.</p>
<p><img src="/img/polyswap_liq_mining.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The entire pool pays out 1.55 <strong>dQUICK</strong> reward tokens each day.  Given my share of the pool (which is very small), I should expect to earn (an estimated) 0.0001995 <strong>dQUICK</strong> per day.  With a <strong>dQUICK</strong> price of around $535.00 at the time of writing, I expect to earn about 10 cents per day, or $36.50 per year.  If I earn $36.5 on $143 invested, that is an APR of 25% which is not bad.  I probably won&rsquo;t get rich doing this, but it is a good way to support QuickSwap and the Polygon network.</p>
<p>This process was a little bit more complicated than the other yield farming examples I wrote about earlier, mostly because it involves a lot of different tokens.  I suspect there is almost no limit to the types of convoluted processes which someone can dream up in DeFi.  QiDao is taking a different approach by offering interest-free loans and it will be interesting to see if this protocol becomes popular in the future.</p>
