Hi! I am Roger. I have a strong passion for finance, equities, and macroeconoimcs.  In addition to my passion for traditional finance, I also have a passion for crypto and blockchain technology.

I run the [BOS] Stake Pool for Cardano.

My goal is to empower others to revolutionise their thinking, open their minds to new disruptive technology & increase their Ada through staking. I want to help build the Cardano ecosystem and contribute to decentralization.

[BOS] stake pool (Ticker: BOS) is a Cardano stake pool that produces blocks on the Cardano Mainnet and aimis to deliver a high ROA for delegators.

For the benefit of delegators, I charge only the minimum fixed fee per epcho (340 ADA) and zero margin.  My goal is to run the best possible stake pool so I can maximize the growth of my Ada, but maximizing profits is not my sole objective.   I am here to learn more about crypto, specifically Cardano, and improve the ecosystem, that is why I do not charge a margin and charge only the minimum allowed staking fee.  This maximizes the potential rewards to my delegators.
