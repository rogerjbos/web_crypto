Cardano [BOS] Stake Pool

#### Why stake with the [BOS] stake pool?
I am committed to providing only top quality staking services to delegators.  I am always learning and improving, with the goal to maximize pool efficiency in block producing capabilities.

#### Staking is simple
With just a few clicks in your [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/) or [Yoroi](https://yoroi-wallet.com) wallet you can access my pool.  Once you are staking within the pool your payouts are automatically sent directly to your wallet every epoch.

#### No need to worry
Your ADA never leaves your wallet and by delegating you will never have to worry about server maintenance, operations, or software updates. Its all handled for you with the lowest possible fees.

#### Rewards
The best part about staking is that your ADA never leaves your wallet & you will always remain in control of your coins, while earning rewards and helping the decentralization of the Cardano mainnet!
