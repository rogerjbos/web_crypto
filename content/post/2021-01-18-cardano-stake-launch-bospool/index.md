After running a few testnets on other blockchains, I decided to go with Cardano for running a mainnet.  I set up my node and relay using the very helpful [Coin Cashew](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-ada/guide-how-to-build-a-haskell-stakepool-node) guide.  If you are looking for a small pool where you can try your luck, this is it.  [Bos] Pool is fully operational and ready to sign blocks with *zero margin* and *minimum fees*, which means more potential return for you!
