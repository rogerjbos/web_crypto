FAQ

#### Could I lose my ADA during staking?
No, your ADA never leaves your wallet when you stake. Staking is a feature built into the [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/) and [Yoroi](https://yoroi-wallet.com) wallets that allows you to delegate your funds for a return on stake in the selected pool.  In case you are not aware, with the [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/) wallet you have to sync up the complete Cardano blockchain while the [Yoroi](https://yoroi-wallet.com) wallet is a light wallet that does not require full syncing.

#### What does it mean to delegate to a stake pool?
Delegation is the Proof of Stake (PoS) process by which ADA holders delegate their ADA to a block producing pool to seek rewards which are produced by minting new blocks.  It allows ADA holders that do not have the skills or desire to run a node to participate in the network and be rewarded in proportion to the amount of stake delegated.

#### Do I need to send my ADA to you to stake?
No, your ada should NEVER leave your wallet or be sent to another wallet to stake. Please be cautious of staking sites asking you to send your funds.

#### Is ther a minimuym amount for staking?
No, there is no minimum amount of ADA that you have to delegate to a stake pool, but there is a small fee to set up a delegation, so it would not be economical to delegate 1 ADA to every stake pool.

#### Can I spend my ADA while I am staking?
Yes!  This is one of the unique features of Cardano.  Your ADA are not locked during staking.  You are free to spend them as usual.  Just transfer them from your wallet and your stake amount will be automatically reflected.  The transfer will be instant and the remaining funds will continue to be staked and earning rewards.

#### Can I switch to another stake pool?
Yes, you may switch at any time from within your [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/) or [Yoroi](https://yoroi-wallet.com) wallet.  If you would like to delegate your ADA to another stake pool, simply select your new stake pool of choice and it will take place after the next epoch.

#### Where do the names Ada and Lovelace come from?
Ada Lovelace was a pioneer of computing science born over two centuries ago.  She took part in writing the first published program and was a computing visionary, recognizing for the first time that computers could do much more than just calculations.  1 ADA = 1,000,000 Lovelace
